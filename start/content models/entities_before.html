<h1>Dont be afraid to be &lt;then a 100% success &amp; &gt;more:</h1>
<p>
	&quot;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arrena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; eho errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without an error and shortcoming; but who dose actually strive to do the deeds; who&nbsp;knows&nbsp;great.&quot;
